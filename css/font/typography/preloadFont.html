<!-- You can request that browsers start downloading a font file as soon as possible. 
 - Add a link element to the head of your document that references your web font file. 
 - A rel attribute with a value of preload tells the browser to prioritize that file. 
 - An as attribute with a value of font tells the browser what kind of file this is. 
 - The type attribute allows you to be even more specific.

 -  Use the CSS font-display property to tell the browser how to manage the switchover from a system font to a web font. You could choose to show no text at all until the web font is loaded.
