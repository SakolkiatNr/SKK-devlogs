module ground rules:
- self contained module
    - everything to do with module  is on module
    - no global variable
    - if module manage more than one thing it should be split up
- seperation of concern
- DRY code: Don't repeat yourself
- efficient DOM usage
    - few selection
- no memory leaks
    - all events can be unbound
